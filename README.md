# ü§ñ TaskWarrior GUI (AI Agent Experiment)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note**: This project is an experimental prototype generated by the Replit AI Agent. It is primarily a demonstration of AI-assisted development and is not yet a fully functional production application. Some features may not work as expected.

A Streamlit-based GUI prototype for TaskWarrior that explores the possibilities of AI-generated task management interfaces.

## üß™ Experimental Status

This project was created as part of an experiment with Replit's AI Agent to demonstrate:
- AI-driven interface design
- Integration with TaskWarrior's backend
- Automated code generation and documentation
- Real-time task management features

Current limitations:
- Urgency calculations may not fully match TaskWarrior's native behavior
- Some TaskWarrior features might not be fully implemented
- Interface elements are in experimental stage

## Features (Prototype Stage)

- üìä Clean, modern interface for TaskWarrior
- üîç Dynamic filtering:
  - Filter by status (Pending/Completed)
  - Filter by priority (High/Medium/Low)
  - Filter by project
- üìà Real-time task urgency calculation and display (experimental)
- ‚ú® Task management:
  - Easy task creation with descriptions
  - Priority assignment (High/Medium/Low)
  - Project organization
  - One-click task completion
- üì± Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile
- üé® Clean and intuitive user interface with:
  - Color-coded priorities
  - Project grouping
  - Urgency scores (experimental)
  - Task status indicators

## Installation

1. Ensure you have TaskWarrior installed:
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install taskwarrior

   # For macOS
   brew install task

   # For other systems, visit: https://taskwarrior.org/download/
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tom-doerr/taskwarrior-gui.git
   cd taskwarrior-gui
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # or
   pip install streamlit pandas
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the displayed URL (typically http://localhost:5000)

3. Using the interface:
   - **Adding Tasks**: Use the sidebar form to add new tasks
   - **Task Properties**:
     - Description (required)
     - Priority (optional: High/Medium/Low)
     - Project (optional)
   - **Filtering**: Use the sidebar filters to sort and filter tasks
   - **Task Actions**: Complete tasks with one click using the action buttons

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Urgency Calculation**:
   - Current implementation may differ from TaskWarrior's native calculations
   - Some coefficients might not match exactly with TaskWarrior's default values

2. **TaskWarrior Integration**:
   - Some advanced TaskWarrior features are not yet implemented
   - Configuration options are limited in this prototype

3. **Interface Limitations**:
   - Some UI elements are in experimental stage
   - Advanced TaskWarrior features might not be accessible

## Troubleshooting

1. **TaskWarrior Not Found**:
   - Ensure TaskWarrior is installed and accessible from command line
   - Try running `task version` to verify installation

2. **Permission Issues**:
   - Ensure TaskWarrior configuration directory exists: `~/.task/`
   - Check file permissions: `chmod -R 700 ~/.task/`

3. **Display Issues**:
   - Try clearing your browser cache
   - Ensure you're using a modern web browser

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- TaskWarrior
- Streamlit
- Pandas
